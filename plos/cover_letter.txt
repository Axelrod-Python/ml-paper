## Reinforcement Learning Produces Dominant Strategies for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

To the editors,

This paper presents a numerical study of novel strategies for the iterated
Prisoner's dilemma.

We feel that this paper presents a strong contribution to the literature as it
not only presents one of the largest Prisoner's Dilemma tournament (made
possible using an open source library with over 40 contributors) but also
describes the use of a number of strategy archetypes. Whilst some of these
archetypes are not in themselves novel (finite state machines for example),
others are (neural networks for example). Furthermore, it is the effective
training of these strategies using reinforcement learning that is a particularly
strong contribution.

A number of results and in depth analysis are presented, not only for standard
tournaments but also for noisy tournaments.

This paper not only offers a good piece of reference text (all strategies are
fully referenced) but offers many insights as to the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning.

Thank you for taking the time to consider our work,

The Authors.
