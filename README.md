# Reinforcement Learning Produces Dominant Strategies for the Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma

This paper gives description of strategies trained using reinforcement learning
as well as a detailed analysis of their performance in a large tournament with
176 strategies.

## Building the article

# Building the article:

The following compiles the article using `Latexmk` version 4.41:

```
$ latexmk --xelatex main.tex
```

The bibliography is being built using `biblatex` which requires `biber`, that
comes bundled with some installs of `latex` but if you are having problems you
might need to run (on ubuntu, similarly for other systems):

```
$ sudo apt-get install biber
```
