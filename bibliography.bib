@article{Nowak1993,
	abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma is the leading metaphor for the evolution of cooperative behaviour in populations of selfish agents, especially since the well-known computer tournaments of Axelrod and their application to biological communities. In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism. Here we present extended evolutionary simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift, which seems to be a widespread rule. Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

	abstract = {Zero-determinant strategies are a new class of probabilistic and conditional strategies that are able to unilaterally set the expected payoff of an opponent in iterated plays of the Prisoner's Dilemma irrespective of the opponent's strategy (coercive strategies), or else to set the ratio between the player's and their opponent's expected payoff (extortionate strategies). Here we show that zero-determinant strategies are at most weakly dominant, are not evolutionarily stable, and will instead evolve into less coercive strategies. We show that zero-determinant strategies with an informational advantage over other players that allows them to recognize each other can be evolutionarily stable (and able to exploit other players). However, such an advantage is bound to be short-lived as opposing strategies evolve to counteract the recognition.},

@article{Press2012,
	abstract = {The two-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is a model for both sentient and evolutionary behaviors, especially including the emergence of cooperation. It is generally assumed that there exists no simple ultimatum strategy whereby one player can enforce a unilateral claim to an unfair share of rewards. Here, we show that such strategies unexpectedly do exist. In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y's score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player's best response is to accede to the extortion. Only a player with a theory of mind about his opponent can do better, in which case Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is an Ultimatum Game.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new paradigm of searching optimal strategies in the game of iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) using multiple-objective evolutionary algorithms. This method is more useful than the existing approaches, because it not only produces strategies that perform better in the iterated game but also finds a family of nondominated strategies, which can be analyzed to decipher properties a strategy should have to win the game in a more satisfactory manner. We present the results obtained by this new method and discuss substrategies found to be common among nondominated strategies. The multiobjective treatment of the IPD problem demonstrated here can be applied to other similar game-playing tasks.},

@article{Li2009,
 abstract = {In recent iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments, the most
             successful strategies were those that had identification
             mechanisms. By playing a predetermined sequence of moves and
             learning from their opponents' responses, these strategies managed
             to identify their opponents. We believe that these identification
             mechanisms may be very useful in evolutionary games. In this paper
             one such strategy, which we call collective strategy, is analyzed.
             Collective strategies apply a simple but efficient identification
             mechanism (that just distinguishes themselves from other
             strategies), and this mechanism allows them to only cooperate with
             their group members and defect against any others. In this way,
             collective strategies are able to maintain a stable population in
             evolutionary iterated prisoner's dilemma. By means of an invasion
             barrier, this strategy is compared with other strategies in
             evolutionary dynamics in order to demonstrate its evolutionary
             features. We also find that this collective behavior assists the
             evolution of cooperation in specific evolutionary environments.},
